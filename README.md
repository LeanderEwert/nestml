# PyNestML - The NEST Modelling Language @Python

NestML is a domain specific language that supports the specification of neuron models in a precise and concise syntax, based on the syntax of Python. Model equations can either be given as a simple string of mathematical notation or as an algorithm written in the built-in procedural language. The equations are analyzed by NESTML to compute an exact solution if possible or use an appropriate numeric solver otherwise.

## Directory structure

`models` - Example neuron models in NestML format.

`pynestml` - The source code of PyNestML.

`tests` - A collection of tests for testing of the toolchain's behavior.

`doc` - The documentation of the modeling language NestML as well as processing toolchain PyNestML.

`extras` - Miscellaneous development tools, editor syntax highlighting rules, etc.

## Installing NESTML

### Requirements

In order to execute the language tool-chain, Python in version 2 or 3 is required.
To ensure correct installation and resolving of dependencies, Python's package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), the distribution tool [setuptools](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) as well as the python headers (``python-dev`` on Ubuntu/Debian, ``python-devel`` on most other linux platforms) package are required and should be installed in advance. The setup file additionally installs the following components:

* [SymPy in the version >= 1.1.1](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)
* [NumPy in the version >=1.8.2](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Antlr4 runtime environment in the version >= 4.7](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/python-target.md)

In the case that no 'enum' package is found, additionally, enum34 has to be updated by
```
pip install --upgrade pip enum34
```

First of all, you should make sure that all required packages are installed.
Requirements are stored in ``requirements.txt`` and can be installed in one step through pip by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

Once all requirements are installed, a setup file is provided and can be run on Python 2 via 
```
python2 setup.py install --user
```
Or for Python 3:
```
python3 setup.py install --user
```

### Testing

Correct installation can then be tested by 
```
python2 setup.py test
\# respectively python3 setup.py test 
```

## Running NESTML

After the installation, the toolchain can be executed by the following command.
```
python PyNestML.py ARGUMENTS
```
where arguments are:<a name="table_args"></a>

| Command        | Description |
|---             |---          |
| -h or --help   | Print help message.|
| --input_path   | Path to the source file or directory containing the model.|
| --target_path  | (Optional) Path to target directory where models will be generated to. Default is `target`.| 
| --target       | (Optional) The name of the target platform to generate code for. Default is NEST.|
| --logging_level| (Optional) Sets the logging level, i.e., which level of messages should be printed. Default is ERROR, available are [INFO, WARNING, ERROR, NO] |
| --module_name  | (Optional) Sets the name of the module which shall be generated. Default is the name of the directory containing the models. The name has to end in "module". Default is `nestmlmodule`. |
| --store_log    | (Optional) Stores a log.txt containing all messages in JSON notation. Default is OFF.|
| --dev          | (Optional) Executes the toolchain in the development mode where errors in models are ignored. Default is OFF.|

Generated artifacts are copied to the selected target directory (default is `target`). In order to install the models into NEST, the following commands have to be executed from within the target directory:
```
cmake -Dwith-nest=<nest_install_dir>/bin/nest-config .
make all
make install
```
where `<nest_install_dir>` is the installation directory of NEST (e.g. `/home/nest/work/nest-install`). Subsequently, the module can either be linked into NEST (see [Writing an extension module](https://nest.github.io/nest-simulator/extension_modules)), or loaded dynamically using the `Install` API function. For example, to dynamically load a module with `module_name` = `nestmlmodule` in PyNEST:
```py
nest.Install("nestmlmodule")
```

PyNestML is also available as a component and can therefore be used from within other Python tools and scripts. After PyNestML has been installed, the following modules have to be imported:
```py
from pynestml.frontend.pynestml_frontend import to_nest, install_nest
```
Subsequently, it is possible to call PyNestML from other Python tools and scripts via:
```py
to_nest(input_path, target_path, logging_level, module_name, store_log, dev)    
```
This operation expects the same set of arguments as in the case of command line invocation. The following default values are used, corresponding to the command line defaults. Possible values for `logging_level` are the same as before ('INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR', 'NO'). Note that only the `path` argument is mandatory:

| Argument      | Type    | Default |
|---            |---      | ---     |
| input_path    | string  | _no default_ |
| target_path   | string  | None |
| logging_level | string  | 'ERROR' |
| module_name   | string  | `nestmlmodule` |
| store_log     | boolean | False |
| dev           | boolean | False |

If no errors occur, the output will be generated into the specified target directory. In order to avoid an execution of all required module-installation routines by hand, PyNestML features a function for an installation of NEST models directly into NEST:
```py
install_nest(models_path, nest_path)
```
Here, `models_path` should be set to the `target` directory of `to_nest()`, and `nest_path` points to the directory where NEST is installed (e.g., `/home/nest/work/nest-install`).

A typical script, therefore, could look like the following. For this example, we assume that the name of the generated module is _nestmlmodule_.
```py
from pynestml.frontend.pynestml_frontend import to_nest, install_nest

to_nest(input_path="/home/nest/work/pynestml/models", target_path="/home/nest/work/pynestml/target", dev=True)

install_nest("/home/nest/work/pynestml/target", "/home/nest/work/nest-install")

nest.Install("nestmlmodule")
...
nest.Simulate(400.0)
```
